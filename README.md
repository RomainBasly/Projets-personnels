Some personal projects and workshops made during my scholarship @ADA Tech School (january 2022 to november 2023)

# Some projects to learn core concepts

#1 Creating a first page of a website using CSS, based on the tutorial of Graven - development on Youtube.
My main learnings of the exercise was to practice some stuff on CSS I have learned many month ago (incorporating a logo, resizing an image, using justify-content, align-items, flex-direction, background-image, padding, margin, importing a Google font) and understanding the logic prevailing behind flex-box, grids and position (relative, absolute).

Result tested on Safari & Brave (Chromium) - April 2022.
