Some personal projects and workshops made during my scholarship @ADA Tech School (january 2022 to november 2023)

# Some project to practice

## Nature Emoi
#1 Creating a first page of a website using HTML & CSS, based on the tutorial of Graven - development on Youtube - around 12 of April, 2022.
Language used : HTML, CSS & JS

My main learnings of the exercise was to practice some stuff on CSS I have learned many month ago (incorporating a logo, resizing an image, using justify-content, align-items, flex-direction, background-image, padding, margin, importing a Google font) and understanding the logic prevailing behind flex-box, grids and position of the items (relative, absolute).

Result tested on Safari & Brave (Chromium) - April 2022.

## Fetching from Coingecko
#2 Creating a simple page to fetch DATA from Coingecko APIs and display it simply to visualize the results - around 14th of April, 2022.
Language used : HTML, CSS & JS

My key learning are : 
- On HTML - CSS : manipulating an invented grid, incorporating a background-attachment image, incorporating several logos on specific parts of the screen.
- On JS : fetching data from several APIs (promises, .then method, async and await), manipulating JSON objects, injecting data into the HTML, making some basic math calculation around the data to display it on the screen.

Result tested on Safari & Brave (Chromium) - April 2022.
