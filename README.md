# Personal-projects
Some personal projects created during my scholarship @ADA Tech School (january 2022 to november 2023)

#1 Creating a first page of a website using CSS, based on the tutorial of Graven - development on Youtube.
My main learnings of the exercise was to practice some stuff I have learned previously (justify-content, align-items, flex-direction, background-image, padding, margin, importing a Google font) and understanding the logic prevailing behind flex-box, grids and position (relative, absolute).

Result tested on Safari & Brave (Chromium) - April 2022.
